 Taskati – Task Management App
A modern task management app built with Flutter to help users organize daily tasks efficiently.
Users can create tasks with a title, description, start time, end time, and end date for better planning.
Form validation ensures inputs are not empty or invalid, with clear error feedback.
Tasks are displayed in a clean, scrollable list with a well-structured UI.
Hive is used as a local database to store tasks securely on the device, allowing offline access and data persistence even after app restarts.
The UI follows Material Design principles with a consistent color system, using Colors.blue.shade900 as the primary action color.
Built using core Flutter widgets such as Scaffold, ListView, Form, TextFormField, and ElevatedButton.
